            What is the most common disease in Golden Retrievers?
          </h4>
          <p class="questions__item-text">
            Among the most common health problems seen in Golden
            Retrievers is hip dysplasia. As in humans, the canine hip is a
            ball-in-socket joint, where the head of the femur (thigh bone)
            rotates smoothly within the socket of the pelvis. These large
            bones are held in place by powerful ligaments.

            Golden Retriever Health Issues. Golden Retrievers are usually
            healthy dogs that live for 10–12 years. However, due to poor
            breeding, some Golden Retrievers may have allergies, heart
            disease, eye issues, hip dysplasia, cancer, hypothyroidism, or
            a bad temperament.

            Why are Golden Retrievers so loved?
          </h4>
          <p class="questions__item-text">
            A golden retriever has a loving and affectionate demeanor. A
            golden retriever is gentle with kids and other animals. A
            golden retriever is loyal to his family. A golden retriever is
            eager to please his owners, making him easier to train.

            Are Golden Retrievers highly allergic?
          </h4>
          <p class="questions__item-text">
            No. The golden retriever sheds a fair amount, so it's
            considered a non-hypoallergenic dog. The amount of hair, and
            therefore the amount of dander, that your golden will spread
            around your home is relatively significant — especially when
            compared to a dog that is considered hypoallergenic, like a
            poodle.

            What months do golden retrievers shed?
          </h4>
          <p class="questions__item-text">
            Golden Retrievers typically shed the most during the fall and
            the spring, as their coats thin and thicken for summer and
            winter, respectively. This period of “blowing their coats”
            typically lasts for around 3 weeks, and it's a doozy!

            How far should a Golden Retriever walk?
          </h4>
          <p class="questions__item-text">
            15 minutes should be the maximum for an 8-week old puppy. If
            your puppy gets tired, flops down, or doesn't want to go, it's
            time to stop. At 3 months, you can go for 20 minutes and at 6
            months, you can walk up to 30 minutes. You must be much more
            careful with leash walking since you and not the puppy control
            the pace.
